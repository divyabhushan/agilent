Log-in to BI Hub Agilent platform as a Power user to manage and configure the report infrastructure.
The **My Organization > Reports** section has the following features:

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Reports Management"
      src={useBaseUrl("admin/reports-welcome.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
  <p>Reports Management</p>
</div>

1. [Categories](#categories): Group and categorize similar reports as per functional/business needs.
1. [Manage Periods](#manage-periods): Each report is traced based on the time-period.
1. [Reports Management](#reports-management): Report management (add/download/delete).

## Categories

To define a new category of reports, click **Add Category**, enter the category name in the box and hit _Enter_. Use the "Edit" ( <img height="15" src={useBaseUrl("static/img/edit.svg")}/> ) icon to rename a category and "Delete" ( <img height="15" src={useBaseUrl("static/img/delete.svg")}/> ) icon to remove a category from the list.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img
      height="400"
      alt="Add Category"
      src={useBaseUrl("admin/add-category.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
  <p>Add Category</p>
</div>

Admins can now group similar reports based on the above-defined categories.

:::warning
If you delete a category all the associated reports and their instances will also be deleted. You can still download the deleted reports from the <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-mode/activity#download-reports')}>Download Reports</Link> Activity section.
:::

## Manage Periods

Time-periods are managed under **My Organization > Reports > Manage Periods** section.<br></br>
The periods are classified as "Monthly", "Quarterly", and "Yearly" labels. Click on the appropriate tab, and click **Add Period** to enter the _Period title (Period name)_ and click **Save**.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="Manage Periods" src={useBaseUrl("admin/add-period.png")} />
  </Zoom>
  <p>Add a new Period</p>
</div>

Once the periods are defined for each label, an Admin can:

- **Freeze** ( <img height="15" src={useBaseUrl('img/lock-closed.svg')}/> ): Freezing a period would prevent any report uploads to this period. In the below screenshot, period "2017" is frozen.
- **Edit** ( <img height="15" src={useBaseUrl('img/edit.svg')}/> ): the period name. The reports uploaded to the edited periods are not affected.
- **Delete** ( <img height="15" src={useBaseUrl('img/delete.svg')}/> ): a period to remove it permanently. The reports associated with the deleted period will be lost.
- **Archive** ( <img height="15" src={useBaseUrl('img/archive.svg')}/> ): a period to restrict the download and uploading any reports 
for this period. "2016" is an archived period in the screenshot below.

<!--
<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img
      height="350"
      alt="Edit period properties"
      src={useBaseUrl("admin/period-properties.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
  <p>Edit period properties</p>
</div>
-->
Admins can now upload the reports to respective periods added in this section.

## Reports Management

The **Reports** section allows the Admins to create a basic centralized CMS-like infrastructure for the reports.<br></br>
A snapshot instance of the report is created, managed, and organized across different segments and periods.<br></br>
Admins must upload/delete the reports following the same combinations of report-segment-period.
There are 2 types of reports:
1. **Web Reports**

 Admin uploads the reports following a `<Report Name>_<Segment Name>_<Period>` matrix. Admin then grants access to the users to download the report(s).

1. **Mobile Reports**

 Users cannot download the mobile reports directly from Agilent web app. The users must explicitly subscribe to these reports. The users receive the subscribed mobile reports in the email.

### Add Report

Add a report and define the attributes(values). 
- Select a Category to add and group similar reports.
- Click **Add Report**, and enter the **Report Name**, **Report Type** (Web or Mobile), **Period Type** (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly), **Start Period** (no periods beyond the selected time-period).

### 1. Create a Web Report

Select the **Report Type** as "Web" and enter all the field values.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Add a new web report" src={useBaseUrl("admin/add-web-report.png")} />
    </Zoom>
    <p>Create a Web report</p>
  </div>

A new web report named "Raw Materials" is created in the "Empoloyee" category.

### 2. Create a Mobile Report

Select the **Report Type** as "Mobile".

- **Parent Report Name** is a mandatory field. Select an existing web report name as the parent.
> Each mobile (child) report binds to its parent web report.
> You can have multiple mobile reports linked to a single web report.

- **Select Frequency**: of the mobile upload.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Add a new mobile report" src={useBaseUrl("admin/add-mobile-report.png")} />
    </Zoom>
    <p>Create a Mobile report</p>
  </div>

## Reports and their attributes

Following are the web and mobile reports:

:::warning
If you delete a web report that is linked (parent to) mobile report(s), this will also delete the child mobile report(s).

## Next Steps

An Admin must grant <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-mode/segment')}>access to reports in the respective segments</Link> after creating the reports.

### Download Report

To download any report, click **Download Report** and select the correct mapping to locate the report file uniquely.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img
        alt="Download Report"
        src={useBaseUrl("admin/download-report.png")}
      />
    </Zoom>
    <p>Download Report</p>
  </div>

The correct combination of Report Name, Segment, Period will fetch and download the desired report.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img
        height="50"
        alt="Download Report"
        src={useBaseUrl("admin/download-success.png")}
      />
    </Zoom>
  </div>

> If the download fails with the below message, ensure you have entered the correct parameters.
  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img
        height="50"
        alt="Download Report"
        src={useBaseUrl("admin/download-failed.png")}
      />
    </Zoom>
  </div>
In the <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/user-mode/abrt')}>download the ABRT reports</Link> section, view the periods for which the reports are available.

### Delete Report Instance

Deleting a report instance will only delete the chosen instance of the report from the selected segment and period.
The same report name may still exist in other segments/periods.

- Click **Delete Report Instance**.
- In the pop-up window, select the right combination of the Period(s), Report, Segment to delete the desired report.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img
        alt="Delete report instance"
        src={useBaseUrl("admin/del-report-instance.png")}
      />
    </Zoom>
    <p>Delete Report Instance</p>
  </div>

You can select multiple Periods, reports, and segments.
Only the reports common to all the segments and periods will be selected and deleted.

:::tip
To delete a Report from all the segments/periods - select the Report name, and select all Period/Segment.
:::

:::warning
Do not select all the parameters, as you may lose crucial reports.
:::

## Troubleshoot

An admin can recover a deleted report from the <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-mode/activity#download-reports')}>Activity</Link> section.
