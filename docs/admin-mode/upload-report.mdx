* <i id="error">The period is Frozen/Archived. Please contact the Administrator.</i>: <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-mode/reports#manage-periods')}>Manage the periods</Link> to un-freeze or un-archive the selected period.
* <i id="error">Report not found for the uploaded file</i>: Either the instance does not exists or the combination of segment and period is incorrect. Check the <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-mode/reports')}>Reports</Link> section.
