The ABRT reports are also classified based on different sub-divisions (Segments) within the organization. You can have a nested hierarchy of segments, with sub-levels.

  * To create sub-levels of a segment, select the ( <img height="15" src={useBaseUrl('img/plus.svg')}/> ) sign. You can select the segments and drag to re-order.
