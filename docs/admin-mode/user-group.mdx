Agilent features are only available to a set of users configured in WindowsAD platform and added to agilent specific group.
An Admin creates *Groups* with specific permissions and then assigns users to these groups.

Agilent user types based on their roles:

| User            | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Super Admin** | User ( most privileged) configured while installing BI Hub. Super Admin is added to the "Admin" group and is the default user.                               |
| **Admin**       | User added to the "Admin" group by the Super Admin. Admins cannot modify "admin" group permissions, nor can add other Admins. Have both admin and user mode. |
| **Power Users** | User added to a custom group by an Admin. Have both admin and user mode. Power users cannot modify group permissions.                                        |
| **User**        | This is a regular user with just user-mode.                                                                                                                  |
## Before you begin

Log-in to BI Hub as a Super Admin with username as `bihubadmin`, and password as `password`.

Go to **Authentication > Add Authentication**. Add "Windows AD" authentication, and assign Groups.
 <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
        <img alt="Sync Windows AD users" src={useBaseUrl('admin/winad-auth.png')}
        />
    </Zoom>
    <p>WindowsAD Authentication</p>
 </div>

## Add Agilent Users

To add multiple agilent users from a group:
1. In **My Organization > Users** section, click **Assign AD Groups** and enter a single Windows AD Group or a list of Groups to pick the agilent users from, and click **Add**.
 <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
        <img alt="Assign WindowsAd Group" src={useBaseUrl('admin/ad-group.png')}
        />
    </Zoom>
    <p>Assign WindowsAD Group</p>
 </div>

 :::important
  The Group(s) added here must already be added in the Authentication settings for Windows AD (as added in the previous section).
 :::
1. Select **Authentication > Windows AD** and click **Sync Users**.

All the users from an assigned Group are added as Agilent users and listed in the **My Organization > Users** section.

<div class="center">
    <Zoom>
        <img alt="Agilent Users" src={useBaseUrl('admin/agilent-users.png')}
        />
    </Zoom>
    <p>Agile Users</p>
</div>

## Create Admins

Only a `bihubadmin` user can create other admins by adding Agilent users to the **Admin** group. 

:::note
No other admin except `bihubadmin` is granted access to the **Admin** group and cannot create more super admins.
:::

* Go to **User Manager > Manage User Groups**
* Select the **Admin** group, and click **ADD**.

screenshot - pop-up

* In the **Add user to group(s)** pop-up, select a user(s) from the list and click **ADD**.

:::note
`bihubadmin` is not allowed to edit the permissions of the **Admin** group. Only a System Administrator must edit the Admin group permissions from the backend.
:::

> To remove a user from a group, select a group and click **Remove** next to a user.

## Create Power Users

Admins must also create one or more Power users.
Admins must grant power users just a minimum set of permissions to administer the users/groups and ABRT reports.

A better approach is to create a custom group with a limited subset of the admin privileges and then add the power users to this custom group.

### 1. Create Agilent Custom Groups

Log-in as an Admin and click **Admin Mode** at the top right corner.

* Go to **User Manager > Manage User Groups**
* Click **Add User Group**.
* Enter a Group's name and click **Create**.
* Click **Manage Permissions** next to your custom group. 
* Enable the desired permissions for a group.

* Following are the available permissions:

<table>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2">Agilent Features</th>
            <th>Permissions</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="4">Report Management</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Upload Report Instance</td>
            <td> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Delete Report Instance</td>
            <td> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>Create Category</td><td> </td></tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="4">Segment Management</td>
            <td>Add Segment</td>
            <td> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>Edit Segment</td><td> </td></tr>
        <tr><td>Delete Segment</td><td> </td></tr>
        <tr><td>Edit Segment Report Permission</td><td> </td></tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="3">Support Management</td>
            
            <td>Edit Support Management</td><td> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td><td> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td><td> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>User Management</td>
            <td></td>
            <td> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>User Group</td>
            <td></td>
            <td> </td>
        </tr>
</table>

### 2. Add users to the Custom group

* Select the custom group, and click **ADD**.
* Search the username(s) and click **ADD**.

screenshot

:::important
All the users(Power users) added to this custom group will have both admin-mode and user-mode with the set of permissions enabled for a group.

<!--
## User Group permissions

ABRT provides a centralized repository to store and retrieve all types of Agilent reports. These reports are secured with restricted access to users based on their roles and privileges.
Admins can <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-mode/user-access')}>manage user access</Link> for each report.

      alt="Agilent Log-in screen"
      src={useBaseUrl("admin/user-add-agilent.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
  <p>Agilent Log-in Screen</p>
</div>

## Next Steps

Log-in to the Agilent platform as a Power user.
